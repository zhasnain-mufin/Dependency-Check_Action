# Welcome to Dependency check action

This action uses the docker image built every night in https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck_Builder. This image includes the updated vulnerabilities database so there is no need to update it. Therefore, it speeds up the test.

# What is Dependency-Check?

This action is based upon the OWASP Dependency-Check [tool](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/), a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project’s dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

# How does it work?

The action has three required parameters:

- `project`: the project name
- `path`: the scanpath
- `format`: the report format

Additionally, you can specify:

- `out`: the output folder location relative to the github workspace, by default it will be `reports`
- `args`: any remaining flags and parameters to the binary, check the [arguments page](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/arguments.html) for valid options

Example:
```

on: [push]

jobs:
  depchecktest:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: depecheck_test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build project with Maven
        run: mvn clean install
      - name: Depcheck
        uses: dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main
        id: Depcheck
        with:
          project: 'test'
          path: '.'
          format: 'HTML'
          out: 'reports' # this is the default, no need to specify unless you wish to override it
          args: >
            --failOnCVSS 7
            --enableRetired
      - name: Upload Test results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
        with:
           name: Depcheck report
           path: ${{github.workspace}}/reports
```

### Error: JAVA_HOME is not defined correctly 
When used in conjunction with the GitHub Action [setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) you will see the error `Error: JAVA_HOME is not defined correctly`

This is due to the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` being changed by the setup-java GitHub Action. To fix this problem you will need to reset `JAVA_HOME` to match how it's being set in the image [Dependency-Check Docker Image](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/blob/main/Dockerfile#L16) within the Depcheck step. 

Example:
```
```yaml
...
- name: Depcheck
uses: dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main
env:
  # actions/setup-java@v1 changes JAVA_HOME so it needs to be reset to match the depcheck image
  JAVA_HOME: /opt/jdk
...
```

# How Do I Use It?
We recommend adding the above example into your .github/workflows directory, using a name of your choice, in this example main.yml.

It should look like this

Once that action kicks off, you should be able to see it running in the actions tab.

Finally, once it has completed, a report will be generated and accessible from the actions tab

Downloading this and opening it in a browser will give you the following (for example)
